# VIM plugins
here is to install vim-plug, a plugin manager
https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

Plugin I use for markdown in VIM:
* For markdown formating: https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown
  Pay attention that you need to use `Plug` and not `Plugin` if you use vim-plug

* To preview you markdown: https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim
